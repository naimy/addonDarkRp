This file contains your custom jobs.
This file should also contain jobs from DarkRP that you edited.

Note: If you want to edit a default DarkRP job, first disable it in darkrp_config/disabled_defaults.lua
	Once you've done that, copy and paste the job to this file and edit it.

The default jobs can be found here:
